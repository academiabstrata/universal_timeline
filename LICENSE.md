# LICENCE

The abstract academia license is separated into two types, namely: knowledge license and code license

## knowledge license

The distribution, copying, modification and redistribution of the created texts, aggregated knowledge, for any purpose is allowed.

## code license

Copying, distributing, executing and modifying the source code is permitted, with any purposes involved, provided that the code license is present in the next modification.

## ATTENTION!

keep in mind that our license does not replace other free licenses within the project. That is, each type of content will have its due credits and its due licenses, being fully respected.
