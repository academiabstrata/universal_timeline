# LICENCE

The abstract academia license is separated into two types, namely: knowledge license and code license

## knowledge license

The distribution, copying, modification and redistribution of the created texts, aggregated knowledge, for any purpose is allowed.

## code license

Copying, distributing, executing and modifying the source code is permitted, with any purposes involved, provided that the code license is present in the next modification.
